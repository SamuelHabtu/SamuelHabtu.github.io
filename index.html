          <p>
            Growing up one of my faveourite things to do was watching computers play against themselves, specifically in fighting games. 
            Since making a fighting game ai would take an enormous amount of time let alone making the fighting game itself I decided to instead pursue this but on a 'smaller' scale not that chess is a simple game but rather it would take less time  to make than making a fighting game visually speaking(since I get to stay in the realm of command line interfaces instead of having to do alot of art etc., that is required for a fighting game).
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally the next step was to look at some chess algorithms and thats when I ran into this video:

          </iframe>
          <p>
            the more I worked on this project the more I began to really enjoy chess, Playing with friends, tough chess ai and even rated games on chess.com; Here is one of my first wins online:
