          Situation: 
          Our team wanted to create an online version of one of our shows that a virtual audience can enjoy, my coworker Arthur was inspired by this video:
          </p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" 
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRLNpQfRb1c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
          </iframe>

          <p>
          After seeing this video, our goal became to create a dynamic virtual environment using unreal engine, our green screen and Vive Trackers.

          Task: 
          We had some major hurdles, the first one was getting everything to work together, and we also needed to seamlessly transition between
          different camera feeds that have distinct chroma key settings due to the varying environmental factors like lighting, elevation and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
          Action: 
          While Arthur worked on setting up the technology, I focused on developing a custom script to automate the adjustment of the chroma key settings adjustment and seamlessly switch between our cameras
          </p>
          <p>
          Result: 
          Thanks to the script we were able to streamline our workflow and provide our virtual audience with an immersive experience.
          Despite some hiccups during the live broadcast due to changes in lightning caused by the presence of a live audience at our studio
          and the limited space our camera operator had to move through due to the in studio audience. Things definitely got a little sweaty in the control room as we tried to adjust the settings on the fly.
          Luckily in the end we managed to still provide our audience with a captivating demonstration.
